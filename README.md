# Study Overview
HIV infection prevalence remains disproportionately high among young Black and Latinx men who have sex with men (MSM), even with increased efforts to expand HIV testing, prevention, and information sharing. Frequent HIV testing is important for early diagnosis and prevention of spread, yet remains low among the communities at highest risk. HIV self-testing provides a convenient alternative to clinic testing and has potential to reach individuals who have never previously tested, or who may not want to test due to reasons such as lack of access, HIV stigma, or mistrust of medical systems and health professionals. Web-based platforms, such as social media, dating apps, and information search sites, have more recently been used for HIV prevention promotion. It is thus critical to determine which of these are most effective and promoting HIV testing and self-care, especially for those at highest risk.

The primary objective of this study was to compare the relative effectiveness of these three types of internet platforms in promoting HIV self-testing among young Black and Latinx MSM at a higher risk of contracting HIV: social media, dating apps, and information search sites. Platform effectiveness was measured using HIV self-test kit ordering rates (number of kits per day). By conducting recruitment in separate waves across the three different types of platforms, with different sites in each wave, and tracking test kit orders over time, the study looked into how to optimize HIV prevention strategies through online promotion. Poisson regression was initially planned to compare ordering rates across platform types, but significant platform-by-wave interactions and differing order rates between sites within the same platform prevented pooling across platforms. Thus, effectiveness was assessed with within-wave comparisons of site-specific ordering rates using pairwise comparisons with adjustment for multiple testing.

The secondary objectives of the study focused on individual-level factors associated with HIV self-test kit ordering. The study examined whether substance use, psychological readiness to test for HIV, HIV stigma, medical mistrust, attitudes toward PrEP, and attitudes toward HIV testing and treatment were related to the likelihood of ordering a kit. By analyzing these variables, the study looked to determine whether differences in ordering behavior were driven by platform characteristics or by participant attitudes and beliefs. These associations were evaluated by comparing these individual measures between participants who ordered a test kit and those who did not, using appropriate statistical tests for continuous (Student's t tests) and categorical (Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests) variables.

# Primary and Secondary Analyses


# Reflection
Table 1 was able to be reproduced nearly identical to the study results, with some minor deviations. The biggest difference between the two was that the original 25th percentile age for the sample was 23, while the reproduced results led to a 25th percentile of 21. While this is a notable difference, the rest of the results were aligned with the original table, and the mean (24.4 years) and standard deviation (3.7 years) of age outlined in the primary manuscript were confirmed in the reproduced results. This suggests that the 25th percentile of age in the original manuscript may have just simply been misprinted or reflected preliminary results that may not be aligned with the final sample. A minor deviation can be observed in the percentage of participants who have taken PrEP in the past 6 months (8.9% in the original vs. 8.7% in the reproduced results). However, the fact that the percentages of those who did and those who have never used PrEP add up to 100% in the reproduced results (and over 100% in the original), this also suggests a misprint in the primary manuscript. Two other deviations are observed in the percentage of those who use condoms about half the time (14.5% in the original vs. 14.6% in the reproduced results) and the percentage of those who didn't get tested for HIV due to a dislike for needles (8% in the original vs. 7.9% in the reproduced results). These small deviations appear to simply be rounding errors between the results. Aside from these small differences, the remaining results align perfectly between the original Table 1 in the manuscript and the reproduced results, including all medians and all count (n) values.
