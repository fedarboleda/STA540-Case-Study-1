# Primary and Secondary Analyses


# Reflection
Table 1 was able to be reproduced nearly identical to the study results, with some minor deviations. The biggest difference between the two was that the original 25th percentile age for the sample was 23, while the reproduced results led to a 25th percentile of 21. While this is a notable difference, the rest of the results were aligned with the original table, and the mean (24.4 years) and standard deviation (3.7 years) of age outlined in the primary manuscript were confirmed in the reproduced results. This suggests that the 25th percentile of age in the original manuscript may have just simply been misprinted or reflected preliminary results that may not be aligned with the final sample. A minor deviation can be observed in the percentage of participants who have taken PrEP in the past 6 months (8.9% in the original vs. 8.7% in the reproduced results). However, the fact that the percentages of those who did and those who have never used PrEP add up to 100% in the reproduced results (and over 100% in the original), this also suggests a misprint in the primary manuscript. Two other deviations are observed in the percentage of those who use condoms about half the time (14.5% in the original vs. 14.6% in the reproduced results) and the percentage of those who didn't get tested for HIV due to a dislike for needles (8% in the original vs. 7.9% in the reproduced results). These small deviations appear to simply be rounding errors between the results. Aside from these small differences, the remaining results align perfectly between the original Table 1 in the manuscript and the reproduced results, including all medians and all count (n) values.
